# gamecheat

#### Ever found yourself stuck in a puzzle, while playing a game?

This repository is just a keep for individual, short (python) codes that I created specifically to solve in-game puzzles/challenges. Each file is independent from the rest and self-documented.

#### ⚠️ This repository is not an actual cheat, since each code interacts only with the user to find a solution, given some information by the user themselves. There is NO interaction with the game itself, either to read data or perform actions.
